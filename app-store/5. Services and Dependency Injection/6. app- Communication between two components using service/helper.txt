in this app
we have just removed our services from all the components and added
directly to the app.module.ts

with this
we have also removed the logging services used separately used in the comoenent
we moved to our accounts.service.ts by importing logging.service.ts inside that.
also we need to attach some metadata if we are using service in something
like component have metadata @Component, directive have metadata @directive
so our service should have some metadata and that is @Injectable() imported form @angualr/core

Now the service will be injectable

We dont add @injectable() to the service you want to inject but to the service where you want to inject something, so the receiving service we could say that to be injected in the service.
we dont need to add to any other service, if we dont want to inject anything in the service like in the logging service, we dont need to add injectable, only add if you expect something to be injected
