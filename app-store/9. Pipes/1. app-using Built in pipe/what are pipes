What are pipes?
Pipes are feature built in angular 2 which basically allows you
to transform your output in your template
This is the main purpose of pipes.

Now there are pipes for different type of outputs and for async and sync data

The basic example is following
we have a username
username = 'Rohit'

<p> {{username}} </p>

Rohit

 now i want to transform it into uppercase without change in property

 <p>{{ username | uppercase   }}</p>

 ROHIT


 Pipe always applied from left to right order
 A | B | C
 first B will be applied on the result of A
 then  C will be applied on the result of B with A
