What are pipes?
Pipes are feature built in angular 2 which basically allows you
to transform your output in your template
This is the main purpose of pipes.

Now there are pipes for different type of outputs and for async and sync data

The basic example is following
we have a username
username = 'Rohit'

<p> {{username}} </p>

Rohit

 now i want to transform it into uppercase without change in property

 <p>{{ username | uppercase   }}</p>

 ROHIT


 Pipe always applied from left to right order
 A | B | C
 first B will be applied on the result of A
 then  C will be applied on the result of B with A

 1. understanding pipes
 2. using bulit in pipes
 3. check out angular.io docs for more on pipes
 4. creating our own pipe
  steps:
  1. create and export class
  2. import PipeTransform, Pipe and implement PipeTransform interface
  3. implement transform method and return the value.
  4. add a decorator Pipe and pass a name in the javascript object {name: 'shorten'}
  5. dont forget to add in app.module under declarations array section.

  //async pipe
  if you return new promise to a property in our class and when you
  output with string interplotion it will result in object when it resolve
  cause Promise are indeed an object and its good.
  by default angualr dont know that it resolved to a string
  so we will use async pipe there to get string output
  {{appStatus | async}}
