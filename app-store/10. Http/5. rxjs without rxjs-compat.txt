Don't forget - if you're using Angular (and therefore also RxJS 6+) and you're NOT using rxjs-compat  (npm install --save rxjs-compat ), you have to use operators like map()  differently:

Instead of

....map(...) 

use

....pipe(map(...)) 

map also needs to be imported:

Instead of 

import 'rxjs/Rx'; 

use

import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
