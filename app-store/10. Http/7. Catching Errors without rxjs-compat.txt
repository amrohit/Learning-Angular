Are you using Angular 6 (and therefore RxJS 6+) and you're NOT using rxjs-compat  (npm install --save rxjs-compat  - you may ignore this lecture then, use the code as shown in the videos!)?

You then have to use the catch()  operator you'll see in the next lecture a bit differently.

Instead of

....catch(error => {
    return Observable.throw(...)
}) 
use

....pipe(catchError(error => {
    return throwError(...)
}))


And make sure to import it:

Instead of 

import 'rxjs/Rx'; 

and 

import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; 

use

import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators'; 

and

import { throwError } from 'rxjs';
